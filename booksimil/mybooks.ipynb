      "comments: The *Art of Navigation* examines the author's life-transforming association with the enigmatic shaman and anthropologist Carlos Castaneda, from a first encounter in 1980 up to the present, more than a decade after Castaneda's death. Journey with a modern-day shaman's apprentice on his more than thirty year trek across the globe, from hedonistic beginnings towards surrender and awakening, from a focus on magic and power to the emergence of love and compassion. The central theme of this memoir is the art of navigation, which entails living life in the spirit of an enchanting treasure hunt - playful, intuitive, fluid, and fully aware.  Starting with a mind-stopping event that occurred shortly after Castaneda's death, the narrative jumps back to follow an action-packed and magical path of discovery through Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Germany, France, Mexico, and the United States. This is the *Art of Navigation* , an unusual and fascinating spiritual awakening into our essential nature. ** \n",

      "comments: **The poignant story of a girl who overcomes unique hardship and deprivation - growing up with a troop of capuchin monkeys - to find ultimate redemption.** In 1954, in a remote mountain village in South America, a little girl was abducted. She was four years old. Marina Chapman was stolen from her housing estate and then abandoned deep in the Colombian jungle. That she survived is a miracle. Two days later, half-drugged, terrified, and starving, she came upon a troop of capuchin monkeys. Acting entirely on instinct, she tried to do what they did: she ate what they ate and copied their actions, and little by little, learned to fend for herself.  So begins the story of her five years among the monkeys, during which time she gradually became feral; she lost the ability to speak, lost all inhibition, lost any real sense of being human, replacing the structure of human society with the social mores of her new simian family. But society was eventually to reclaim her. At age ten she was discovered by a pair of hunters who took her to the lawless Colombian city of Cucuta where, in exchange for a parrot, they sold her to a brothel. When she learned that she was to be groomed for prostitution, she made her plans to escape. But her adventure wasn’t over yet...  In the vein of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"City of God,\" this rousing story of a lost child who overcomes the dangers of the wild and the brutality of the streets to finally reclaim her life will astonish readers everywhere.  ** \n",
